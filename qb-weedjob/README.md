 # Functions

    This is a script designed to create a easy to use and configure weedjob for players to farm weed in the same style as qb-recyclingjob
    it is fully customisable regarding props and dropoff location as wenn as picking location.
    qb-weedjob has a built in teleporter as well as blip but it is disabled by default and uses the teleporter from the qb-teleport script
